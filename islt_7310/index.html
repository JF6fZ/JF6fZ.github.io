            <p>This website is a digital portfolio displaying my work, credentials, and academic journey! 
                It includes some projects I’ve worked on over the years, and a description of my academic career up to this point. 
                This website was developed for ISLT 4355 Web Design and Development which I’m taking in my junior year of school. 
                It consists of 5 pages which display different aspects of me. There’s an about me page which details some of my credentials as an academic. 
                The next page is a shortened portfolio containing four projects I’ve been working on over the last year. 
                Then I have a page reflecting on my academic career and explaining my goals for the future, and finally my contact information! 
                The goal is for this website to demonstrate my proficiencies as a computer scientist and give an idea of the journey 
                I’ve been on to get to where I am today.</p>
