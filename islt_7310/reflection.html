                <p>
                    <a id="letter">M</a>y academic career has been very challenging but rewarding. My first year of school was a major adjustment like it is for many people. 
                    I was moving to a new state, didn't know anyone, and had no idea what I was doing. My first computer science class—CS 1050—gave me my first 
                    clue that I had a knack for programming. I didn't take my classes too seriously in the fall, but spring semester I began to realize the 
                    opportunities that were available at Mizzou. It was a difficult semester, but in CS 2050 I got my first exposure to data structures and 
                    immediately fell in love. 
                </p>
    
                <h4>2023</h4>
                <p>
                    My sophomore year was difficult personally and academically, but it's where I began focusing my interests and seriously considering 
                    an advanced degree. I took my first class on Geographic Information Systems: Geography 3040 and attended seminars on topics within 
                    and adjacent to the field. I also became more involved on campus. I was appointed as the Executive Chief of Staff of the Residence 
                    Halls Association, became a peer mentor in the College of Engineering, and tutored through the Learning Center. Each of these 
                    involvements were fulfilling in their own way, but my involvement forced me to learn to use my time efficiently and prioritize tasks. 
                    Towards the end of the year, I completed one of my first major projects in GIS, got a co-op for spring 2025, and was accepted into the 
                    McNair Scholars Program.

                <h4>2024</h4>
                <p>
                    This year I've been focused on preparing for my future academic pursuits. I'm preparing to apply for the accelerated master's program 
                    through EECS and hoping to do more research algorithms. I'm also in the middle of my research on Dijkstra's Algorithm with Dr. Uhlmann.  
                    I'm still a Peer Mentor with the CoE, and I am now the Vice President of RHA. I've never felt more equipped for or excited about my future 
                    than I do now. This past summer I began learning about programming languages and have been reading academic papers on the topic as well.  
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    Moving forward I hope to continue my studies and attain more advanced degrees. I'm already preparing to apply for my master's at Mizzou, 
                    afterwards I want to get my PhD. From there, I want to work in one of a few areas: for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, 
                    at a research lab somewhere solving problems, working on a programming language, or teaching as a professor at a university!
