            <b>Hi!</b> My name is Julian Fletcher. This is my third year at Mizzou, and I’m studying <em>computer science!</em> Additionally, 
            I’m taking classes in geography, math, and IT for my minors. I’m very involved on campus. 
            I’m the Vice President of RHA, a peer mentor in the College of Engineering, and a Resident Advisor. 
            I love everything I’m involved in. They allow me to meet new people and make campus a better place! Missouri is currently my home, 
            but I’m originally from Minnesota! I chose Mizzou because I wanted to go to school out of state, and this was the closest school I liked! 
            I plan to get my master’s degree and PhD in computer science. I plan to focus my research on programming languages or graph algorithms. 
            Once I’m done with school, I hope to work in a research lab in the industry or become a professor and teach someday!
        </p>
